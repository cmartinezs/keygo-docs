# Phase 6: Development

## Purpose

This phase defines the **technical implementation**: architecture, APIs, coding standards, workflows, observability, and technology stack. This is where requirements become code.

## What This Phase Produces

| Deliverable | Description | Time to Complete |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| [architecture-dimensions/](./architecture-dimensions/README.md) | Architecture dimensions (Internal, Deployment, Communication, Infrastructure) | 4-6 hours |
| [api/](./api/README.md) | API design styles (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket) | 2-3 hours |
| [coding/](./coding/README.md) | Coding standards (principles, SOLID, patterns, naming) | 2-3 hours |
| [auth/](./auth/README.md) | Authentication, Authorization, Validation (optional) | 2-3 hours |
| [dr/](./TEMPLATE-020-adr.md) | Architecture Decision Records | 30 min per ADR |
| [observability/](./observability/README.md) | Logs, metrics, traces, health checks (optional) | 2-3 hours |
| [data-storage-patterns/](./data-storage-patterns/README.md) | Database storage: Relational, NoSQL, Cache, Object, Search, Datalake | 2-3 hours |
| [api/rest/](./api/rest/README.md) | Endpoint catalog + templates | 3-4 hours |
| [workflow/](./workflow/README.md) | Branches, commits, PRs, CI/CD (optional) | 1-2 hours |
| [glossary/](./glossary/README.md) | Technical terms reference by category | 1-2 hours |
| [frontend/](./frontend/README.md) | Frontend: Web, Mobile, Desktop, UI Design, State, Integration | 2-3 hours |

## Diagram Convention

This phase uses diagrams to visualize:
- Architecture layers (flowchart using Mermaid)
- API flow sequences (sequence diagram using Mermaid)
- Authorization hierarchy (graph using Mermaid)
- Database relationships (erDiagram using Mermaid)

```
Priority: Mermaid → PlantUML → ASCII
See: navigation-conventions.md in 00-documentation-planning/
```

## Development Philosophy

### Why It Matters

Development phase bridges requirements and code. Without clear specifications:
- Teams make inconsistent architectural choices
- APIs become fragmented
- Code quality degrades over time
- New team members can't understand decisions

### Core Principles

1. **Architecture First**: Define structure before writing code
2. **API-First**: Design contracts before implementation
3. **Document Decisions**: Future engineers need to understand "why"
4. **Standards Enable**: Conventions make code reviews faster

### Relationship with Previous Phases

```
Planning (Phase 5)
    ↓
    → Epics → Architecture structure
    → Use cases → API endpoints
    → Proposals → Tasks → Workflow

Requirements (Phase 2)
    ↓
    → RFs → API requirements
    → RNFs → Non-functional specs

Design (Phase 3)
    ↓
    → Bounded contexts → Modules
    → Domain events → Event contracts
    → Ubiquitous language → Code naming
```

## AI Assistance

### What AI Can Do Well
- Generate API contract templates
- Write basic entity structures
- Suggest validation rules
- Document patterns
- Create ADR templates

### What Needs Human Input
- Technology stack decisions
- Security decisions
- Performance requirements
- Team workflow preferences
