## 🎯 Learning Paths

### "I want to generate documentation FAST with AI" ⭐

1. Open [`AI-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md`](./AI-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md) — "General Flow" section
2. Prepare your product information (20 min)
3. Follow "Day 1: Preparation"
4. Then Day 2-3: Discovery, Day 4-5: Requirements, etc.
5. Check [`INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md`](./INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md) if you need specific prompts
6. **Result**: Complete documentation in 10-15 days

### "I want to validate my work with Claude Code Skills" ⭐⭐

1. Read [`SKILLS-AND-PLUGINS-GUIDE.md`](./SKILLS-AND-PLUGINS-GUIDE.md) — "General: All useful skills"
2. Identify skill by phase (Design → `/domain-driven-design`, Code → `/code-craftsmanship:clean-code`, etc.)
3. Follow "Recommended Workflow by Day"
4. Run "Checklist: Before Production"
5. **Result**: Code and docs validated by experts

### "I want to see a real example step by step"

1. Read [`EXAMPLE-IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./EXAMPLE-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
2. Case: Generating docs for Keygo (real product)
3. Day 1: Prepare information
4. Day 2-3: Generate Discovery
5. Follow the pattern for remaining days
6. Adapt examples to your product

### "I have disorganized documentation and want to centralize it"

1. Read this folder to understand structure
2. Map your existing documentation to the 12 phases
3. Fill gaps with AI
4. Centralize in this structure

### "I want to understand if the DDD + Hexagonal approach is for me"

1. Read [`TEMPLATE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](./TEMPLATE-ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Read `../01-templates/00-documentation-planning/sdlc-framework.md`
3. Decide whether to adapt or create your own structure

### "I have problems generating documentation with AI"

1. Go to [`INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md`](./INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md) → "Troubleshooting"
2. Read the case that resembles yours
3. Or check [`AI-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md`](./AI-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md) → "Advanced Troubleshooting"
4. Adjust your prompt according to the suggested solution

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Agnostic vs. Specific

- **Phases 1-5** (Discovery → Planning): **Technology agnostic**
  - Describes "what", not "how"
  - No framework names, languages, DB
  - Focus on business and user

- **Phases 6-12** (Development → Feedback): **Specific to your stack**
  - Here you mention your technology
  - Real architecture, APIs, code
  - Technical focus

### 2. Iterative, not Waterfall

Each feature/domain can be in different phases simultaneously.

### 3. Traceability

Requirements traced from Discovery → Design → Development → Testing → Monitoring.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping phases** — Tempting but causes incoherence
   - Solution: Make quick versions if in a hurry, but don't skip

2. **Mixing agnostic with specific in phases 1-5**
   - Solution: Use [`INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md`](./INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md) as checklist

3. **Not validating documents with skills**
   - Solution: Read [`SKILLS-AND-PLUGINS-GUIDE.md`](./SKILLS-AND-PLUGINS-GUIDE.md), use skill by phase

4. **Generating everything at once without validating**
   - Solution: Generate phase by phase, validate with corresponding skill, adjust

5. **Not providing enough context to AI**
   - Solution: See ["Provide context, don't ask it to invent"](./INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-AI.md#2-provide-context-dont-ask-it-to-invent)
